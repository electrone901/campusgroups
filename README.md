## Inspiration

Sell Your Stuff App gives users the ability to buy, rent, sell and request items they need from other people, all in one app.
Our app allows you to trade items you no longer want, need, or use for new stuff. Our app is designed to keep usable goods circulating instead of collecting dust on a shelf or taking up space in a landfill.

## What it does

- Allows users to list/post furniture, electronicsm books, notes, class materials, presentations, and more.
- Allows users to compare the sale price vs retail price.
- Users can add new prices
- It gives users a more accurate picture of the item before buying it
- Users can send or receive tips for sharing their reviews
- Users can send or receive tips
- It provides additional information for potential buyers to make a more informed decision before buying any item
- All items such as furniture, electronics, books, notes, class materials, and courses notes are represented as NFTs
- Easily collect accurate information that is available to the public using blockchain technology

## How we built it

Sell Your Stuff App application makes use of the following software:

- `Kovan Network` enables the Sell Your Stuff App to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Kovan Network.

- `Polygon Network` enables our application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Polygon Network.

- `Optimism Network` enables our app to be secure and cost-effective. We deployed our app on the Optimism Network
- `Valist` facilitated the process of distribution of our in a secure way.

- `Len Protocon` made it easy to authenticate users in a seamless way. This allows our users to access our app anywhere in the world.

* `Covalent API` was really helpful for users' transactions and tips. This facilitated the retrieval of usersâ€™ NFTs and smart contract transactions. The Covalent API endpoints to get all NFTs balance and metadata from a wallet address such as images, contracts name, NFTs images, and balances.

- `IPFS NFTStorage` for data storage on IPFS that generates a transaction hash used to create an NFT of a photo.

- `textile/eth-storage`: facilitated a fast way to store metadata for NFTs such: as names, locations, descriptions, images, wallet addresses, and more. It was perfect for our use case to save their needs on textile storage.

- `NFTPort` smooths the path of the minting and donating process and eliminates the high transaction fees. Our users will not pay anything for donating NFTs or minting.

- `Solidity` for the smart contract.
- `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for faster development of our smart contract.

- `Ganache` for local blockchain development.

- `Rinkeby Network` is the network where we deployed our app.

- `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into

The smart contract functionality took us longer.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the final MVP and how our project went from an idea to a demo

## What we learned

We learned to work with IPFS NFTStorage and hardhat

## What's next

Post updates Upon registration, add a point system for users.
